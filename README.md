# Linux
## customized Dotfiles

I migrated to Linux a year ago from Windows, I can't say how much I wish I had done it sooner. it's amazing and very useful :heart_eyes: <br/>
some may say it's complicated and it's not worth the trouble of learning beacause it's true that there's a lot to learn and memorize but as a coder I love a good challenge. And at the end of the day you have your own custom operating system, doesn't it sound great? and also you will learn more and deeper about what the heck is going on in your system. everything you have on your computer is what you choose to have.<br/>
One of my favorite things about Linux is Windows managers (WMs).<br/>
They are very fascinating and very useful. I really like them, I may have just tried some of them but when I came across Qtile, I kind of fell in love with it.<br/>
And there's the ZSH, also called the Z shell, with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. yay!<br/>
I think as a Front-end developer I have a thing for themes and customization :relaxed: Just try your own experience I hope you find it as amazing as I found it.<br/>



  ### This is my Linux btw :upside_down_face:

### Installation:
* Qtile:
```
sudo pacman -S qtile
```
[Qtile site for its documentation](http://www.qtile.org/)

* Zsh:
```
sudo pacman -S zsh (for ArchLinux)
```
#### My custom dotfile:
```
If you want to try mine you need to save them on your system with $ git clone https://github.com/nda-kd/Linux.git<br/>
and then copy Qtile folder in /home/user/.config and .zshrc in /home/user
```

I hope you find it useful :slightly_smiling_face:
